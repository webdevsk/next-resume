/* DO NOT add margin/padding on the print version of the pdf. The Print-screen/puppeteer will add margin based on the @page settings for every single page */

/*Substract the expected margin twice from the initial pdf size. For A4 size its 210mm */

/* @pdf property and values have to be raw static css. So use the same margin value in both --pdf-margin and @page margin respectively. Use the variable anywhere in your project for non print mode if needed */

/* puppeteer print mode is weird regardless of headless mode. It doesn't even respect manually set viewport size in print mode. For this portrait document the viewport seems to be between 480 and 500. Point to note that it depends on pdf margin as well. */

/* Set the lowest viewport size to @media(min-width: 480px) to tackle this issue. For mobile, use initial sizes. For print, use @media(min-width: 480px). If you decrease the pdf margin, you can crank up the lowest viewport slightly if you want. Though you have to test it the hard way */

/* How to test: Style an element with an obvious difference in mobile and non mobile view. Something like className="text-red-500 xs:text-blue-500". Then crank up the lowest viewport by 20. Generate pdf using puppeteer and see if it chose the mobile version or non mobile version. If it chose the non mobile one (text is blue) you are good to go */

/* As this project has Tailwind, you can create an even smaller viewport "xs". Add it in tailwind.config.js and use xs:property-styles as base styles for printing. */

/* The css mode in puppeteer is set to screen mode. So @media print{} won't work */

/* For example */

.test {
  /* for mobile browsers */
  @apply px-4;
  /* for print and non mobile browsers */
  @apply xs:px-8;
}
